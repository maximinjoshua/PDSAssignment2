## Sample and Population Statistics

| Statistic    | Sample Value | Population Value |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Mean Glucose | 116.64        | 120.8945            |
| Max Glucose  | 183          | 199              |

The mean glucose level of the sample closely estimates the population's mean. Though the maximum glucose level of the sample population is not a close estimate as the mean glucose level, it is still a sensible estimate. So, the current sample explains the mean and maximum values in the dataset well.

| Statistic       | Sample Value | Population Value |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 98th Percentile BMI | 40.248           | 47.5259               |

The samples 98th percentile BMI is 40 apprx whereas the population's 98th percentile is 47. If we are dealing with a problem which has a significant weightage for outlying values, this sample cannot be considered a good estimate. The dataset should be sampled more times and an average should be taken for the 98th percentile.

| Statistic    | Bootstrapping Value | Population Value |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Mean | 69.1769        | 69.1054            |
| STD  | 19.0737          | 19.3558              |
| 98th percentile  | 97.9024          | 99.3199              |

The bootstrapping results of the mean, standard deviation and 98th percentile of Blood pressure is almost an exact estimate of the corresponding population values. This shows how sampling can be leveraged via bootrstrapping to give an nearly accurate estimate of original values when we have limited resources to analyze data.
